<H3>About Us</H3>

<p>A contract manufacturing (CM) company that manufactures electronic circuit 
boards for arge OEMS (Original Equipment Manufacturers). The OEMS design the hardware and circuits,
the CMS build the boards using the designs provided. The CMS use state-of-the-art nufacturing assembly 
techniques which include automated assembly lines where machines ace the parts on pre-printed circuit 
boards, send them through ovens where the parts are ldered to the boards, and wash the boards after they 
are soldered. The process involves t ups of the placement machines for each board; programming the profiles 
of the "ovens" the temperatures are appropriate for the boards. After the boards come off the lines,
they are tested has context menu using Automated Test equipment. Failures are tracked and brought to an -house Failure 
Analysis lab to determine why the parts are failing and to determine ere in the process problems might be 
occurring.
